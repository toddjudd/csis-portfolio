<p>Whether we're composing a blog or a business letter, 
an <b>email</b> or an essay, our goal should be to respond 
clearly and <strong>directly</strong> to the needs and interests of 
our readers. These 10 tips should help us sharpen 
our writing whenever we set out to inform or persuade.</p>

<h3>Lead with your main idea.</h3>
<p[>As a general rule, state the main idea of a paragraph 
in the first sentence--the topic sentence. Don't keep 
your readers guessing.</p>

<h3>Vary the length of your sentences.</h3>
<p>In general, use short sentences to emphasize ideas. 
Use longer sentences to explain, define, or illustrate 
ideas.</p>

<h3>Put key words and ideas at the beginning or end of a 
sentence.</h3>
<p>Don't bury a main point in the middle of a long sentence. 
To emphasize key words, place them at the beginning 
or (better yet) at the end.</p>

<h3>Vary sentence types and structures.</h3>
<p>Vary sentence types by including occasional questions 
and commands. Vary sentence structures by blending simple, 
compound, and complex sentences.
</p>
<h3>Use active verbs.</h3>
<p>Don't overwork the passive voice or forms of the verb 
"to be." Instead, use dynamic verbs in the active voice.</p>

<h3>Use specific nouns and verbs.</h3>
<p>To convey your message clearly and keep your readers 
engaged, use concrete and specific words that show what 
you mean.</p>

<h3>Cut the clutter.</h3>
<p>When revising your work, eliminate unnecessary words.</p>

<h3>Read aloud when you revise.</h3>
<p>When revising, you may hear problems (of tone, emphasis, 
word choice, and syntax) that you can't see. So listen up!</p>

<h3>Actively edit and proofread.</h3>
<p>It's easy to overlook errors when merely looking over your 
work. So be on the lookout for common trouble spots when 
studying your final draft.</p>

<h3>Use a dictionary.</h3>
<p>When proofreading, don't trust your spellchecker: it can 
tell you only if a word is a word, not if it's the right word.</p>
