			The end of the 18th century was the beginning of a new era.  Men like George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were shaping a country that would one day be a beacon of freedom to the world. During this time, the foundation of this country was forged by iron ink, in the form of a document we know as the Constitution of United States of America.  It was soon followed by an accompanying document known as the Bill of Rights. It was these two documents that upheld the standard “that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” (US 1776). These works were not made lightly, they were the direct result of years being subjected to a king and fighting for freedom, and now looking for the best way to establish and maintain the freedom which was won. The Bill of Rights in particular expressly reflects this desire to gain and maintain freedom. In its First Amendment, it granted the right to freedom of speech, press, petition, and assembly. Thomas Jefferson saw the value of this right and stated “Our liberty cannot be guarded by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited without danger of losing it” <a>(Jefferson)</a> Jefferson realized the power of press in keeping the public informed and keeping the government in check. He also understood that were we to give the government the ability to limit that right inevitably it would be taken from us.
		</p>

		<p>
			Today however, the primary form of press and information is not the printing press, but the internet. Back in the 1960’s during the peak of the cold war, the Department of Defense was looking into the possibility of creating back up communications between coasts in the event of a nuclear fallout. With the current telecommunication system a well-placed bomb, could easily knock out communications within the states. In 1964, a man by the name of Paul Baran came up with a solution otherwise unheard of at the time. He purposed a network of high speed data transfer wires connecting everywhere to everywhere with no governing authority, not much unlike a national postal system devised by a madman <a>(Elmer-Dewitt)</a> this system has grown and evolved to be the connective and innovative force it is today. Now instead of military communication though the internet is used for all sorts of things including the spread of news and media, the sharing and collection of ideas, and the all too popular social networking.
		</p>

		<p>
			With the continuing growth of the internet and the variety of uses and information that can be published via the World Wide Web, governments are beginning to question whether or not there should be a governing entity over the flow of information. This is because of the plethora of unsightly content against the government contrary to common constitutional, moral, and ethical standards. However if we were to examine closely our Constitution or the Bill of Rights, we would undoubtedly realize that it is not ethical nor constitutional for the U.S. Government to censor for the internet whether for origin foreign or domestic. Doing so would be damaging to our free market economy hindering innovation, creativity, and economic growth; allow the United States Government control of information both malicious and profitable, allowing them to mold the minds of their citizens without opposition; and ultimately infringe upon the First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and press.

			On November 12th 2015, Isis launched several attacks of terror on Paris, France. First, during a soccer game being held at the Stade de France a bomb was detonated to the north of the stadium killing two people. Minutes later, men armed with assault rifles began shooting civilians in Paris’ 10th District where fifteen people were killed. More explosions and shootings followed, the terror lasting for well over thirty minutes where 129 people were killed. Immediately following Hollande issued a state of emergency <a>(Mariano Castillo)</a>. According the New York Times in an article by the Editorial Board, this state of emergency includes provisions for the government to impose curfews, ban public assemblies, wear electronic tracking bracelets, seize computers, track keystrokes and even censor the internet coming in and out of France. All of this can now be done without judicial oversight. These new provisions are supposedly for the safety of the citizens of France and necessary in order to fight the war on terror. However, as stated in the previously cited article, this rushed legislation will only harm the very freedoms the terrorists seek to destroy, and create the potential for governmental abuse <a>(The Editorial Board)</a>. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The state of emergency declared by France is not the first attempt at censorship though. In China, more than one in four websites that are normally accessible through Google or other search engines is blocked through a four level filtering process. Currently, the black list in China contains more than 923 websites and is ever growing <a>(Gaille)</a>. Words such as ‘democracy,’ ‘nude,’ ‘sex,’ and ‘naked’ are blocked by governments all over the world. Internet journalism is overly censored and ideas contrary to the government can lead to imprisonment or even death. In Afghanistan journalist Sayed Pervez Kambaksh was sentenced to death for publishing an article on woman’s rights, and in 2008 China had over forty-eight bloggers and journalist serving time for expressing their views online <a>(Good.Is)</a>. Internet censorship is a real problem all over the world and is knocking on America’s door. We need to stand up as an example to all countries and nations that it is not acceptable to allow governmental censorship of the internet. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There are many damaging effects of internet censorship in their article “New Technologies, Innovative Repression: Growing Treats to Internet Freedom.” Sanja Kelly and Sarah Cook exploit how the internet is engrained in our civilization and how censorship will have lasting effects on our economy and the progress of innovation. Kelly and Cook explain that from the creation of the internet back in the 1960’s till today, the internet has evolved and expanded as a means to spread information all over the world. Over two billion people currently have access to the internet, which is more than twice the amount of users as five years ago. Now, more and more people use the internet to communicate, obtain information, socialize, progress innovation, and conduct commerce <a>(Cook)</a>. It is certainly true that the nature of the internet its self is the perfect environment for these uses to grow and evolve. Innovation and e-commerce are two major benefits of the internet that thrive on a free and open net. However as Kelly and Cook state, the government is constantly working at creating ways to control and regulate the internet thus hampering the ability of e-commerce and innovation to flourish. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Among the legislation the government is trying to pass in order to control the internet are the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA). Fight for the Future, a nonprofit organization that works to maintain the freedom of the internet, explained these acts as being aimed at allowing the government and the entertainment industry decide what sites should be censored from the public. This threatens sites such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, and other social media and DNS sites by making it possible for them to be sued and incarcerated simply for allowing a user to post media or information contrary to the will of the government or the entertainment industry. It also threatens smaller companies and startups by giving established companies the ability to abuse the system and censor their newer competition. It’s acts such as these that put companies on un equal ground hampering e-commerce and stifling innovation by removing the ability for internet users to communicate  and share information freely and openly (CATO Institute). In direct defiance of the government taking any action such as this, Mark Zuckerberg posted this to his Facebook wall 
			
			<p>
				“The internet is the most powerful tool we have for creating a more open and connected world. We can’t let poorly thought out laws get in the way of the internet’s development. Facebook opposes SOPA and PIPA, and we will continue to oppose any laws that will hurt the internet. 
				“The world today needs political leaders who are pro-internet. We have been working with many of these folks for months on better alternatives to these current proposals. I encourage you to learn more about these issues and tell your congressmen that you want them to be pro-internet” <a>(Forbes)</a>.
			</p>

			As Mark put it, Laws such as SOPA and PIPA will only harm the internet in turn impeding the innovation, communication, and economic growth that it brings with it. It’s not just the internet that needs saving though as we will see it’s also our freedom that is at stake.

		</p>

			In 1933, The Nazi’s began their control of the German Government. The Nazi regime began the suppression by making it a crime to criticize or oppose the government. They created laws and organizations to control and censor the German aspects of culture, or in other words controlling all forms of entertainment and press, and publishing all sorts of pro-Nazi propaganda. Following this pattern of censorship Nazi students chose to burn books, effectively censoring the history and western ideas that were contrary to the Nazi beliefs <a>(Black)</a>. The effects of this rise to power by the Nazi regime are well known around the world as the Holocaust and WWII, it is the rise to power that men often forget. This is problematic in that if we do not pay attention history will repeat itself.
		</p>

		<p>
			By censoring all forms of media and information Hitler removed all outside influence and opposition allowing him to mold the minds of his people, most importantly the younger generation which because the loyal generation that fought his war for him. Just as Hitler and the Nazi’s censored the media, press, and information available to the common people; so are our governments trying to censor the internet, the largest source information known today. For the time being it may be true that internet censorship is pleasing to the eye of our governmental officials because of the possible benefits it would have in the war on terror. It may be easy to assume that censoring the internet will remove all that undesirable content on the web such as pornography and digital pirating. However obscenities are not the only reason for our government or any other to desire the ability to censor the internet. 
		</p>

		<p>
			According to a report done by researchers Robert Faris and Nart Villeneuve entitled “Measuring Global Internet Filtering” the top three topics censored by government around the world are free expression and media freedom, political transformation and opposition parties, and political reform and governance <a>(Robert Faris and Nart Villeneuve)</a>. How is the censoring of political parties that oppose the current government any different than the laws implemented by the Nazi regime in 1933? The future possibility of the government abusing this authority, should we give it to them, and the loss of freedoms such as  free speech and knowledge; does not quantitate the meager and marginal gains society might hope to achieve by allowing the government total control in censoring the internet. Freedom from corrupt government is much too important as is the example we set for countries around the world.
		</p>

		<P>
			France may not share the same freedoms that the United States enjoys, but there are certain God given rights that every man should possess so that his government does not become his demise. These were outlined in the first ten Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. First and foremost is the freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly. Jefferson, as stated before, realized this when he said “Our liberty cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that be limited without danger of losing it” <A>(Jefferson)</A>. In other words Jefferson was stating that the by exercising and maintain the freedom of press and speech, we will defend our liberty against those who seek to take it from us; this includes both adversaries foreign and domestic. Should we allow anyone even our own government to limit our ability to spread news or freely express ourselves, the limitations will continue until the day when the freedom no longer exists.
		</P>

		<P>
			The internet is a form of media, press, and speech. The government is seeking to limit what can be posted, and read via the internet, but by limiting this it is a direct violation of the first amendment. During a hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had the same thing to say. They stated,
				<P>
				“Not only is censorship inconsistent with American values, it also is counterproductive to preventing extremist violence. There are critical constitutional limits even when it comes to fighting the so-called ‘war on terror’ online. The Internet is, and must remain, the most open marketplace of ideas in the history of the world. Limiting its reach has a direct impact on the speech and privacy rights of all Americans. Trading our civil liberties for the promise of security will leave us with neither” (American Civil Liberties Union).
				</P>
			Thus even in times of emergency and war, there are certain limits we must not exceed. The sacrifice of liberty for security is one of them. The U.S. was created on the basis of freedom and liberty. This Amendment was put in place to maintain that freedom and protect us from the government. If we now allow the government to extend its reach and take this right from us how can we expect to retain any other liberty we possess? 

		</P>

		<p>
			Even in light of the claims made some may still challenge or even reject my views insisting that we should jump at the chance to remove such things as online pirating, pornography, and all sorts of illegal and obscene content from the internet. According to the CATO institute the entertainment industry wants to pass legislature in order to protect against piracy and copy right infringement of their media <a>(CATO Institute)</a>. In the fight against child pornography and even pornography in general British politician Ed Vaisey had this to say, “This is a very serious matter. I think it is very important that it's the ISPs that some up with solutions to protect children … I'm hoping they will get their acts together so that we don't have to legislate” <a>(Davies)</a>. Piracy, and pornography are real issues with real costs, but internet censorship will not stop either of these problems nor any others of the many issues it claims to be able to solve. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The truth is anyone can download a simple plugin or tinker with a few settings to get around these censors. In fact, after quickly Google for “how to bypass internet censorship” I found a blog post entitled “5 Ways to Bypass Internet Censorship and Filtering” by howtogeek.com, a reliable source of tech news and know-how. All of these steps are easy to follow and could be done by even the most basic of users. So, do we really think that government censored internet could possibly aim to stop or even hinder the already thriving industries that are online piracy and pornography? Of course not. The only for seeable result of internet censorship is the possibility of governmental abuse, infringement upon civil freedom, and the hindrance of the benefits of the internet such as economic growth and innovation.  
		</p>

		<p>
			In all reality though, if legislation such as SOPA and PIPA pass, it will be the initial stepping stone in the progressive loss of free speech and free knowledge. Governments, especially the United States of America, should not pass any legislation to further or permit the censorship of the internet by the government. It would do nothing but frustrate the purpose of the internet hampering economic growth and innovation. I can only allow for the opportunity of governmental abuse of the new found power, giving oppressive regimes the abilities needed to thrive and grow. Finally it would fundamentally restrict and or remove our right to free speech, free press, and free expression. Please actively fight against this movement no matter what the cost. Do not allow even the most stressful terrorist evens to skew your view for even a moment so as not to pass rash legislation in a moment of panic.
