	<h1>Another Big Headding</h1>
	<h2>This is a Heading</h2>
	Hello. This is not a very exciting document. I bet you were expecting <em>poetry</em>, or some kind of <strong>exciting <br> fact</strong> about the Internet and the World Wide Web.
	<p>Sorry, No such luck. This document does contain examples of HTML markup, for example, here is an "unordered list":</p>
	<ul>
		<li>one item in the list</li>
		<li>A second List Item</li>
		<li>A third list item that goes on and on and on to indicate that the lists can wrap right around the page and still nicely formatted by the browsers.</li>
		<li>the final item on the list</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Lists are exciting. You can also have orderedlists (the items are numbered) and decription lists.</p>
	<hr></hr>
	<p>And you can drqw horizontal lines. wich are useful for dividing sections.</p>
