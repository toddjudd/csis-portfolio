		<h1>Who Is This Guy?</h1>
		<center><img src="resources/todd-portugal.jpg" class="photo-center"></center>
		<p>My name is Todd! I'm America, but I recently spent two years in Portugal where this photo was taken. I'm a pretty good guy. I like to dance, code, game, and hangout. I've been crazy about computers for quite a while. I've always been good at gamming, and I actualy met my Two best friends seen in this photo over here through our love of pc's video games and dance. Funny story, I moved right be for my senior year and I had to go to a new high school. I had heard about a ballroom dance team and though to my self "what losers." Turns out when I saw their first performance my thoughts immediently changed to "I gotta get on that team so I can dance with all those pretty girls!" <img src="resources/todd-grady-parker.jpg" class="photo-left"> These two dorks were on team and we ended up becoming good friends. We spent tons of time working on computers, mostely breaking them, but sometimes fixing them. I've learned a lot about computers from them and built this PC.</p>
