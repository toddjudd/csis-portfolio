			<h1>The Top Attackers in Rainbow Six Siege</h1>
			<br>
			<h4>Here is a list of the best attackers in Rainbos Six Siege!</h4>
			<div class="list-container">
				<ol>
					<li>Glaz</li>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<p><img src="/resources/glaz.png">Timur "Glaz" Glazkov is an Attacking Operator featured in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. He holds a medium armor and mobility rating and features a HDS Flip sight as his unique ability for his signature OTs-03 marksman rifle.</p>
						<li>Glaz's OTS-03 DMR is a man killer and provides max stopping power at all distances</li>
						<li>Glaz's HDS Flip Scop allows him to extend his kill range and scale it back to fit his situation. this lets him sit back and keep the enemy at bay or move up to the close range fight and push the objective.</li>
						<li>Finaly Glaz has 2 armor and 2 speed this means he can get up and move when necessecary but he can still take a hit with out going down.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<li>Sledge</li>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<p><img src="/resources/sledge.png">Seamus Cowden hails from the upper tip of the Scottish Highlands. Due to his imposing physical stature and athleticism, he found early success as the Captain of the 1998 Scotland National under-20 Rugby Union Team. Having a strong desire for public service, it inspired Cowden to enlist in the army at 18 where he was assigned to the 3rd Divison. After five years of active duty, he was recruited by the SAS.</p>
						<li>Using the hammer makes less noise than an exploding breaching charge, so you can use it to surprise your enemy by creating a path from an unexpected direction.</li>
						<li>Sledge is the operator to choose for quick and relatively silent destruction. His breaching hammer can be used to quickly go through multiple destructible walls, floors and barricades</li>
						<li>Though impractical, Sledge's breaching hammer is capable of killing enemies in one hit. This as a humiliating kill, ant worth it if you pull it off.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<li>Thermite</li>
					<br>	
					<ul>
						<p><img src="/resources/thermite.png">Jordan "Thermite" Trace is an Attacking Operator featured in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. He has a medium armor and mobility rating and is the only Operator capable of breaching reinforced walls with the Brimstone BC-3 Exothermic Charge.</p>
						<li>Thermite is an unstoppable breacher, a very useful operator to pick while playing against enemies who are heavy on fortifications.</li>
						<li>He is the only Operator that can blow up reinforced walls with his exothermic charge. You can either customize Thermite's loadout with Frag Grenades, to attack enemies following a breach, or with the standard Breach Charge, to flank the enemies' defenses and use one of the charges as a diversion.</li>
						<li>Be careful though: exothermic charges can't be detonated while inside a Jamming Device radius so make sure it is clear of one before wasting your charges. They can also be disabled once triggered if they are shot or receive explosive damage before they detonate.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<li>Montagne</li>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<p><img src="/resources/montagne.png">The son of an army officer and school teacher, Montagne's family was stationed near Bordeaux, France. A few years after he graduated from high school, Montagne became a member of the National Gendarmerie. Dedicating his life to the defense work, his commitment has allowed him to obtain a position on the GIGN. After many years of service and involvement in numerous incidents such as the 1994 French Airline hijacking, Montagne has become the longest-serving GIGN operative.</p>
						<li>Montagne is the ultimate pointman to breach the enemy lines: he can expand his shield to fully cover him from head-to-toe while standing, providing extra cover for him and those behind him.</li>
						<li>The inclined top part also provide extra cover from enemy fire from above. While Montagneâ€™s shield is expanded, he cannot use weapons or do melee, so make sure you have a teammate with you that can engage in combat while protected by Montagne.</li>
						<li>Montagne is very useful to block a tight area from enemy fire since he cannot have his shield stance broken by melee attacks, but be careful in open areas: Montagne is slower when the shield is expanded and his back is left open to enemy fire.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<li>Ash</li>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<p><img src="/resources/ash.png">Born and raised in Jerusalem, Israel, Cohen enrolled at Tel Aviv University after secondary school in the Engineering program. It was during this time she did a semester abroad in Boston University. After college, she enlisted in the Israeli Defense Forces. Her engineering background made her a great candidate for mechanical maintenance and demolitions..</p>
						<li>Ash can fire 2 remote breaching charges to surfaces that would normally be hard or impossible to reach, like higher windows or even ceilings: enemies rarely expect the floor beneath them to blow up so use this to surprise them.</li>
						<li>Remote breaches will detonate automatically once they get stuck on a wall, meaning that they cannot be affected by a Jamming Device, making them the best way to breach against a team with Mute in its rank.</li>
						<li>The Remote Breach Launcher is also very useful to destroy a wall from a safe distance if you expect enemy fire. Keep in mind that it is not a rocket launcher and will do reduced damage to players.</li>
